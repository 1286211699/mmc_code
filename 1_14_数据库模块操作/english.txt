When I was only six years old, in a book about primitive forests called True Story, I saw a wonderful illustration of a boa constrictor eating a big beast. A copy of the painting is on the head of the page.
The book reads: "These pythons swallow their prey without chewing, and then they can't move any more; they digest the food in a six-month long sleep."
At that time, I thought a lot about the adventures in the jungle, so I also drew my first picture with colored pencils. My first work. It is like this:
I showed my masterpiece to adults, and I asked them if my painting frightened them.
They answered me, "What's so terrible about a hat?"
I'm not drawing a hat. It's a python digesting an elephant. So I drew the inside of the python so that adults could understand it. These adults always need to explain. My second work is as follows:
Adults advised me to put aside the pictures of pythons with bellies open or closed, or to put my interests in geography, history, arithmetic and grammar. In this way, at the age of six, I gave up my wonderful career as a painter. I was discouraged by the unsuccessful work No. 1 and No. 2. These adults, who know nothing by themselves, have to constantly explain to them. It really bores the children.
Later, I had to choose another profession. I learned to fly airplanes, and almost all over the world. Indeed, geography has helped me a lot. I can tell China from Arizona at a glance. It's useful if you lose your course at night.
