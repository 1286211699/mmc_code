Beginning tomorrow, be a happy person
Feeding horses, chopping firewood, traveling around the world
Starting tomorrow, care about food and vegetables
I have a house facing the sea with spring blossoms.
From tomorrow onwards, communicate with every family member
Tell them my happiness
What the lightening of happiness has told me
I will tell everyone
Give a warm name to every river and mountain
Stranger, I wish you well too.
May you have a brilliant future
May your lover be married
May you enjoy happiness in this earthly world
I just want to face the sea, spring blossoms
